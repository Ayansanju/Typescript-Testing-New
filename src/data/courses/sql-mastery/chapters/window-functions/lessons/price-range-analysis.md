The bookstore wants to analyze how books perform compared to other books with similar prices. For each book, they want to see the average sales of books within $5 of its price (i.e. if the book is priced at 20, they want to see the average sales of books priced between 15 and 25).

Given the following data in table `book`:

| id  | title            | category      | price | copies_sold |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1   | SQL Basics       | Programming   | 29.99 | 1500        |
| 2   | Advanced SQL     | Programming   | 49.99 | 2500        |
| 3   | Data Science     | Data Analysis | 39.99 | 2000        |
| 4   | Web Development  | Programming   | 34.99 | 1800        |
| 5   | Statistics 101   | Data Analysis | 24.99 | 1200        |
| 6   | Python Basics    | Programming   | 29.99 | 3000        |
| 7   | Machine Learning | Data Analysis | 44.99 | 2200        |
| 8   | Database Design  | Programming   | 34.99 | 1700        |
| 9   | R Programming    | Data Analysis | 34.99 | 1600        |

Write a query that shows:

- Book title
- Price
- Book's copies sold
- Average copies sold of similarly priced books (within $5 range)
- Number of books in that price range

Order the results by price (ascending) and title (ascending).

## Expected Output

| title            | price | copies_sold | similar_price_avg | books_in_range |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Statistics 101   | 24.99 | 1200        | 1900              | 3              |
| Python Basics    | 29.99 | 3000        | 1800              | 6              |
| SQL Basics       | 29.99 | 1500        | 1800              | 6              |
| Database Design  | 34.99 | 1700        | 1933              | 6              |
| R Programming    | 34.99 | 1600        | 1933              | 6              |
| Web Development  | 34.99 | 1800        | 1933              | 6              |
| Data Science     | 39.99 | 2000        | 1860              | 5              |
| Machine Learning | 44.99 | 2200        | 2233              | 3              |
| Advanced SQL     | 49.99 | 2500        | 2350              | 2              |

> **Note:** You can use the `RANGE BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING` clause to create a window that includes all rows where the price is within Â±$5 of the current row's price.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT
    title,
    price,
    copies_sold,
    ROUND(AVG(copies_sold) OVER (
        ORDER BY price
        RANGE BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING
    )) as similar_price_avg,
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        ORDER BY price
        RANGE BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING
    ) as books_in_range
FROM book
ORDER BY price, title;
```
