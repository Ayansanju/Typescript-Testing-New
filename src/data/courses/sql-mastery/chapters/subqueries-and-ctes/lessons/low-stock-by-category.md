The bookstore manager wants to identify books that have lower stock than the average stock level in their respective categories. This will help in planning reorders.

Given the following data in table `book`:

| id | title           | category      | price | stock |
| -- | --------------- | ------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 1  | SQL Basics      | Programming   | 29.99 | 10    |
| 2  | Advanced SQL    | Programming   | 49.99 | 5     |
| 3  | Data Science    | Data Analysis | 39.99 | 8     |
| 4  | Web Development | Programming   | 34.99 | 3     |
| 5  | Statistics 101  | Data Analysis | 24.99 | 15    |
| 6  | Machine Learning| Data Analysis | 44.99 | 6     |
| 7  | Python Basics   | Programming   | 29.99 | 12    |
| 8  | R Programming   | Data Analysis | 34.99 | 4     |

Write a query that shows books with stock levels below their category average. Show:

- Book title
- Category
- Current stock
- Category average stock (rounded to 1 decimal place)

## Expected Output

| title           | category      | stock | category_avg |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Advanced SQL    | Programming   | 5     | 7.5         |
| Web Development | Programming   | 3     | 7.5         |
| R Programming   | Data Analysis | 4     | 8.3         |
| Machine Learning| Data Analysis | 6     | 8.3         |

> **Note:** The query must use a correlated subquery to calculate the category average.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    b1.title,
    b1.category,
    b1.stock,
    ROUND((
        SELECT AVG(stock)
        FROM book b2
        WHERE b2.category = b1.category
    ), 1) as category_avg
FROM book b1
WHERE b1.stock < (
    SELECT AVG(stock)
    FROM book b2
    WHERE b2.category = b1.category
);
```
