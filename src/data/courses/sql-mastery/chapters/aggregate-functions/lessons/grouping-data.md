In our previous lesson, we learned about basic aggregate functions. While these functions are useful, they become even more powerful when combined with the `GROUP BY` clause.

The `GROUP BY` clause allows us to group rows that have the same values in specified columns and then perform aggregate calculations on each group.

## Basic GROUP BY Syntax

The basic syntax for using `GROUP BY` is:

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

Let's look at some examples using our bookstore `sale` table.

| id  | sale_date  | amount | category    | store_location |
| --- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1   | 2024-01-15 | 29.99  | Fiction     | Downtown       |
| 2   | 2024-01-15 | 19.99  | Non-Fiction | Suburb         |
| 3   | 2024-01-16 | 24.99  | Fiction     | Downtown       |
| 4   | 2024-01-16 | 39.99  | Technical   | Suburb         |
| 5   | 2024-01-16 | 14.99  | Fiction     | Downtown       |
| 6   | 2024-01-17 | 49.99  | Technical   | Downtown       |
| 7   | 2024-01-17 | 27.99  | Non-Fiction | Airport        |
| 8   | 2024-01-17 | 22.99  | Fiction     | Downtown       |
| 9   | 2024-01-18 | 17.99  | Non-Fiction | Suburb         |
| 10  | 2024-01-18 | 34.99  | Technical   | Airport        |

## Grouping by Single Column

Let's find the total sales amount for each book category:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sale
GROUP BY category;
```

The output from this query will look like this:

| category    | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Fiction     | 92.96       |
| Non-Fiction | 65.97       |
| Technical   | 124.97      |

### How does this work?

Let's break it down and see how it works behind the scenes.

**Step 1:** The `GROUP BY` clause creates the groups based on the `category` column i.e. `Fiction`, `Non-Fiction`, and `Technical`:.

[![](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/grouped-data-my35f.png)](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/grouped-data-my35f.png)

Now that we have the groups, we can perform the aggregate function on any column in the group. In this case, we want to calculate the total sales amount for each group.

**Step 2:** The `SUM(amount)` function calculates the total sales amount for each group.

**Step 3:** The result is returned with the `category` and `total_sales` columns as the output.

Let's take another example and count how many sales we have for each store location using the same `sale` table:

```sql
SELECT
    store_location,
    COUNT(*) as sale_count
FROM sale
GROUP BY store_location;
```

The output from this query will look like this:

| store_location | sale_count |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Airport        | 2          |
| Downtown       | 5          |
| Suburb         | 3          |

## Grouping by Multiple Columns

You can group by multiple columns to get more detailed insights. For example, let's find the total order count for each category and store location:

```sql
SELECT
    store_location,
    category,
    COUNT(*) as sale_count
FROM sale
GROUP BY store_location, category;
```

The output from this query will look like this:

| store_location | category    | sale_count |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Airport        | Non-Fiction | 1          |
| Airport        | Technical   | 1          |
| Downtown       | Fiction     | 4          |
| Downtown       | Technical   | 1          |
| Suburb         | Non-Fiction | 2          |
| Suburb         | Technical   | 1          |

## Multiple Aggregate Functions

You can also use multiple aggregate functions in the same query. For example, let's find the total sales and average sales for each category:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales,
    AVG(amount) as avg_sale_value
FROM sale
GROUP BY category;
```

The output from this query will look like this:

| category    | total_sales | avg_sale_value |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Fiction     | 92.96       | 23.24          |
| Non-Fiction | 65.97       | 21.99          |
| Technical   | 124.97      | 41.66          |

Let's take another example and find the total number of sales and the total amount of sales for each store location:

```sql
SELECT
    store_location,
    COUNT(*) as sale_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sale
GROUP BY store_location;
```

The output from this query will look like this:

| store_location | sale_count | total_sales |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Airport        | 2          | 62.98       |
| Downtown       | 5          | 142.95      |
| Suburb         | 3          | 77.97       |

Similarly, the total number of sales and the total amount of sales for each store location and category (i.e. multiple group columns):

```sql
SELECT
    store_location,
    category,
    COUNT(*) as sale_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sale
GROUP BY store_location, category;
```

The output from this query will look like this:

| store_location | category    | sale_count | total_sales |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Airport        | Non-Fiction | 1          | 27.99       |
| Airport        | Technical   | 1          | 34.99       |
| Downtown       | Fiction     | 4          | 92.96       |
| Downtown       | Technical   | 1          | 49.99       |
| Suburb         | Non-Fiction | 2          | 37.98       |
| Suburb         | Technical   | 1          | 39.99       |

## Conditional Aggregate Functions

Before we talk about adding conditional logic to our aggregate functions, let's talk about the `CASE WHEN` statement.

### CASE WHEN

The `CASE WHEN` is SQL's way of writing IF-ELSE logic in our `SELECT` statement. It is quite powerful and helps us write conditional column values.

Let's say that we want to assign a price category to each sale based on the amount of the sale i.e.

| if sale amount   | price_category |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| `< 25`           | Budget         |
| `>= 25 AND < 40` | Regular        |
| `>= 40`          | Premium        |

We can achieve this by using the `CASE WHEN` statement in our `SELECT` statement i.e.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    sale_date,
    category,
    amount,
    CASE
      WHEN amount < 25 THEN 'Budget'
      WHEN amount >= 25 AND amount < 40 THEN 'Regular'
      ELSE 'Premium'
    END as price_category
FROM sale
ORDER BY price_category;
```

This would categorize each sale like this:

| id  | sale_date  | category    | amount | price_category |
| --- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------- |
| 3   | 2024-01-16 | Fiction     | 24.99  | Budget         |
| 8   | 2024-01-17 | Fiction     | 22.99  | Budget         |
| 9   | 2024-01-18 | Non-Fiction | 17.99  | Budget         |
| 2   | 2024-01-15 | Non-Fiction | 19.99  | Budget         |
| 5   | 2024-01-16 | Fiction     | 14.99  | Budget         |
| 6   | 2024-01-17 | Technical   | 49.99  | Premium        |
| 10  | 2024-01-18 | Technical   | 34.99  | Regular        |
| 4   | 2024-01-16 | Technical   | 39.99  | Regular        |
| 7   | 2024-01-17 | Non-Fiction | 27.99  | Regular        |
| 1   | 2024-01-15 | Fiction     | 29.99  | Regular        |

Notice how it added the `price_category` based on the amount of the sale.

### Combining CASE WHEN with Aggregates

Now let's combine `CASE WHEN` with aggregate functions to analyze our sales. Let's find the total number of sales and the number of sales in each price category for each category:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) as total_sales,
    COUNT(CASE
        WHEN amount < 25 THEN 1
        END) as budget_sales,
    COUNT(CASE
        WHEN amount >= 25 AND amount < 40 THEN 1
        END) as regular_sales,
    COUNT(CASE
        WHEN amount >= 40 THEN 1
        END) as premium_sales
FROM sale
GROUP BY category;
```

This query would output something like:

| category    | total_sales | budget_sales | regular_sales | premium_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Fiction     | 4           | 3            | 1             | 0             |
| Non-Fiction | 3           | 2            | 1             | 0             |
| Technical   | 3           | 0            | 2             | 1             |

In the next lesson, we will learn about grouping and filtering data using the `HAVING` clause.
