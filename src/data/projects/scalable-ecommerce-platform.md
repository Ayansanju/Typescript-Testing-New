Build a robust, scalable e-commerce platform using microservices architecture and Docker. This project will provide hands-on experience with modern cloud-native technologies and distributed system design.

## Core Microservices:

Here are the core microservices to implement:

-   **User Service:** Handles user registration, authentication (JWT, OAuth 2.0), profile management, and role-based access control (RBAC).
    -   Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
-   **Product Catalog Service:** Manages product listings, categories, inventory, and search functionality (Elasticsearch).
    -   Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
-   **Shopping Cart Service:** Handles user shopping carts, including adding/removing items, updating quantities, and applying discounts.
    -   Database: Redis (for caching) and PostgreSQL.
-   **Order Service:** Processes orders, tracks order status, manages order history, and generates invoices.
    -   Database: PostgreSQL.
-   **Payment Service:** Integrates with external payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal), handles payment processing, and ensures secure transactions.
-   **Notification Service:** Sends email and SMS notifications for order confirmations, shipping updates, and promotional messages.
    -   Integrates with third-party services (Twilio, SendGrid).
    -   Message queue usage (RabbitMQ, or Kafka)
-   **Review Service:** Manages product reviews, and ratings.

## **Additional Components:**

Enhance scalability, reliability, and manageability with:

-   **API Gateway (Kong, Traefik, NGINX):** Serves as the entry point, routes requests, handles authentication, and implements rate limiting.
-   **Service Discovery (Consul, Eureka):** Automatically detects and manages service instances.
-   **Centralized Logging (ELK Stack):** Aggregates logs for monitoring and debugging.
-   **Containerization (Docker):** Containerizes microservices for portability.
-   **Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Manages container deployment, scaling, and networking in production.
-   **Message Queue (RabbitMQ, Kafka):** Implements asynchronous communication.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions):** Automates build, test, and deployment.
-   **Caching (Redis):** Improves performance and reduces database load.
-   **Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana):** Monitors platform health and performance.

## Steps to Get Started:

1.  **Planning and Design:** Define API contracts, database schemas, and service interactions.
2.  **Development:** Implement microservices using a suitable language (Python, Node.js, Java, Go).
3.  **Testing:** Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
4.  **Containerization:** Create Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files.
5.  **Orchestration:** Deploy microservices on Kubernetes.
6.  **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack.
7.  **CI/CD:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
8.  **Security:** Implement authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
9.  **Documentation:** Document all services and configurations.
