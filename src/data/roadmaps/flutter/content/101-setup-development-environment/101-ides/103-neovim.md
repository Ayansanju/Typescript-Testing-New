# NeoVim

Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

With Flutter we can install the package:
- [@opensource@flutter-tools](https://github.com/nvim-flutter/flutter-tools.nvim)
