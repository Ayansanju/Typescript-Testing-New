# Options API

Vue offers many approaches for how to write components, including the Options API. It is the only API that is available in all versions of Vue. It's primary focus is on providing a consistent and clean organized aproach to writing component logic. Each part of a component's logic is given a dedicated section (data, methods, computed, props, life-cycle hooks, etc). By putting the logic in the correct section it has access to those framework features automatically. With the official Vue ESLint plugin the order of the sections can be enforced across all components allowing developers to predicatably locate any part of the component, even if they've never looked at the file before.
