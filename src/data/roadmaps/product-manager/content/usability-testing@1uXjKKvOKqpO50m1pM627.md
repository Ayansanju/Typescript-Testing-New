# Usability Testing

Usability testing is a crucial aspect in a Product Manager's role. It essentially involves evaluating a product or feature by testing it with representative users. As a Product Manager, they must ensure that usability testing is performed at various stages of product development to understand and improve user satisfaction and experience. It provides direct input on how users use and perceive a product. Often, it is the Product Manager's responsibility to facilitate this process, from selecting suitable user groups to facilitating the sessions and analysing the results for future product iteration and improvement. Understanding usability testing allows Product Managers to identify any design problems and necessary improvements before full-scale product launch.
