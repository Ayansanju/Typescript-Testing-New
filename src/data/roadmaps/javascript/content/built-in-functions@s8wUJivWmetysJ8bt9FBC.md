# Built in functions

- JavaScript provides a variety of built-in functions that help perform common tasks efficiently. These functions are available globally or within specific objects and do not require explicit definition.

- For example, functions like parseInt(), setTimeout(), and Math.random() are built-in and can be used directly. Additionally, JavaScript objects such as Array, String, and Date come with their own built-in methods, allowing powerful operations on data structures.

- Understanding built-in functions helps streamline development by leveraging JavaScriptâ€™s core capabilities without reinventing the wheel.
