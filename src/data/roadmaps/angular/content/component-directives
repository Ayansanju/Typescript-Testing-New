### Component Directives in Angular

#### Definition:
Component directives in Angular are **specialized directives** that define a **component**â€”the basic building block of an Angular application. A component directive is created using the `@Component` decorator and includes metadata that describes how to render the component and manage its behavior.

#### Purpose:
- **Encapsulation**: Components encapsulate template (HTML), styles (CSS), and logic (TypeScript), promoting modularity and reusability.
- **UI Building**: Each component corresponds to a piece of the user interface.
- **Hierarchy**: Components form a tree structure, allowing you to create complex UIs by nesting components.

#### Key Features:
1. **Selector**: Defines how to use the component in the template (like a custom HTML tag, attribute, or class).
2. **Template/TemplateUrl**: Specifies the HTML structure for the component.
3. **Styles/StyleUrls**: Provides styling specific to the component.
4. **Lifecycle Hooks**: Allows components to respond to events during their lifecycle (e.g., initialization, destruction).
5. **Inputs and Outputs**: Facilitates communication between parent and child components.
