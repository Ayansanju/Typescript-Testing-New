# Understanding APIs
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) define how different software components communicate with each other (typically a client and server). They establish a set of protocols and standards that developers can use to access the functionality or data of another system without needing to understand its internal code. The most common types are REST and GraphQL, but many other standards exist, such as SOAP, WebRTC, gRPC, MQTT and websockets. 

## When consuming an API:
- You send requests to an endpoint via a protocol such as HTTP.
- You receive responses often in JSON or XML formats.
- API authentication is typically required (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
