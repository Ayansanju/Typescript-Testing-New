# Presentation Techniques

Presentation Techniques for Developer Relations Professionals

### 1. Know Your Audience
Why: Developers are skeptical, practical, and often short on time—they want substance, not fluff.
How:Research the event (e.g., PyCon vs. a local meetup) and audience (beginners, experts, specific tech stack users).
Tailor your content: APIs for backend devs, UI tips for frontend, etc.
Anticipate their pain points (e.g., “How does this save me time?”).
Example: If presenting to Python devs, demo your tool in Python, not Java.

### 2. Start with a Hook
Why: Grab attention in the first 30 seconds—developers will tune out if you bore them.
How:Open with a bold statement: “This bug cost us $1M—here’s how we fixed it.”
Use a relatable problem: “Ever struggled with slow CI builds?”
Show a quick, impressive demo (e.g., 10-second setup of your tool).
Example: “I’m going to show you how to cut your deploy time in half—live.”

### 3. Keep It Technical, But Simple
Why: Developers want depth but hate jargon-heavy nonsense.
How:Explain concepts in plain language: “This API caches results so you don’t hit the server twice.”
Avoid overused buzzwords (e.g., “disruptive,” “game-changer”).
Use analogies sparingly—focus on real-world use cases.
Example: “Think of this like git rebase, but for your cloud config.”

### 4. Show, Don’t Just Tell
Why: Code and demos beat slides full of text every time.
How:Live-code a small example (e.g., integrate your SDK in 5 lines).
Use pre-recorded demos as a backup if Wi-Fi fails.
Highlight results: “See? 50% faster with one config tweak.”
Tip: Practice your demo 10x—glitches kill credibility.

### 5. Structure with a Clear Flow
Why: Developers need a logical path to follow your point.
How:Use the “Problem-Solution-Benefit” framework:
Problem: “Debugging this takes hours.”
Solution: “Our tool logs it automatically.”
Benefit: “You fix it in minutes.”
Limit slides: 1 idea per slide, max 10-15 total for a 30-minute talk.
End with a call-to-action: “Try it free at this URL.”
Example: Slide 1: “The Pain of X.” Slide 2: “How Y Solves It.”

### 6. Engage with Interactivity
Why: Passive listeners forget—active ones remember.
How:
Ask questions: “Who’s hit this error before?”
Run a quick poll: “Raise your hand if you use Docker.”
Invite a volunteer for a live demo tweak.
Tip: Keep it natural—forced interaction feels awkward.


### 7. Master Q&A
Why: Developers love to challenge you—it’s your chance to shine.
How:Listen fully before answering—don’t interrupt.
Admit when you don’t know: “Great question, I’ll dig into that and follow up.”
Pivot tough questions: “That’s a bit edge-case, but here’s how most users handle it.”
Example: “Why’s it slow?” → “Good catch—let’s look at the latency stats.”

### 8. Use Visuals Wisely
Why: Slides should support, not distract from, your message.
How:Code snippets: Big font (18pt+), syntax-highlighted, 5-10 lines max.
Diagrams: Simple (e.g., API flow), not cluttered.
Avoid text walls—use bullet points or images.
Tip: Dark mode slides are easier on eyes in dim conference rooms.

### 9. Bring Energy and Authenticity
Why: Developers connect with real people, not robots.
How:Speak like you’re chatting with a friend—skip the formal monotone.
Share a quick story: “We built this after a 3 a.m. outage.”
Smile, move naturally, and use gestures (but don’t overdo it).
Example: “I was skeptical too, but this saved my weekend.”

### 10. Handle Nerves Like a Pro
Why: Even seasoned DevRel pros get jittery—control it to look confident.
How:Practice out loud 3-5 times (record yourself to spot quirks).
Breathe deeply before starting—slows your pace.
Focus on 1-2 friendly faces in the crowd, not the whole room.
Tip: Mess up? Laugh it off: “Oops, that’s why we test!”

### 11. Provide Takeaways
Why: Developers want something actionable to use later.
How:Share a GitHub repo link with your demo code.
Give a cheat sheet: “3 steps to get started.”
Offer a QR code to docs or a free trial.
Example: “Scan this to grab the slides and code.”

### 12. Adapt to Time and Tech
Why: Conference schedules shift, and tech fails—be ready.
How:Prep a 5-minute version of your 20-minute talk.
Bring backups: Slides on USB, demo offline-ready.
Skip a section if time’s tight—focus on the core message.
Tip: Test the projector/clicker beforehand.


Bonus Tips
Humor: A light tech joke (e.g., “Works on my machine!”) can warm up the room—just keep it relevant.
Pace: Speak slower than you think—nerves speed you up.
Feedback: Ask a dev friend to critique your dry run.
Why These Work for DevRel
These techniques balance technical credibility with audience connection—key for inspiring developers to trust and use your tools. Practice them, and you’ll turn a room of skeptical coders into fans of your product. Want to brainstorm a specific talk idea? Let me know!
