# Basic Backend Development

Basic backend development involves creating the server-side logic and infrastructure that powers web applications and services. For AI agents, this often means building custom APIs that agents can call as tools, setting up databases to store agent memory or application data, handling user authentication, and managing the server environment where the agent or its supporting services might run. Understanding basic backend concepts is crucial for creating bespoke functionalities for agents, enabling them to interact with proprietary data sources or execute specific actions not covered by off-the-shelf tools.
