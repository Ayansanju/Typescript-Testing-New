# Biome

Biome is an open-source, opinionated code quality tool for JavaScript, TypeScript, and other modern programming languages. It combines features of both linting and formatting, ensuring code adheres to best practices while maintaining consistent style across a project. Similar to ESLint, Biome helps identify potential errors, enforce coding standards, and reduce bugs by detecting issues early in the development process. It also offers automatic formatting, much like Prettier, to standardize code style without the need for manual intervention. With Biome, developers can streamline their workflows, as it supports real-time feedback through editor integrations, pre-commit hooks, and build processes. Its zero-config philosophy and extensibility make it a versatile and efficient tool for teams of all sizes. By automating fixes and improving code readability, Biome enhances productivity and reduces cognitive load, helping developers focus on writing high-quality code.
