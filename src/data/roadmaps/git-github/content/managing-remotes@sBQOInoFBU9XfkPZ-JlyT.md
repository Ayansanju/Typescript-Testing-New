# Managing Remotes

A remote repository in Git is a copy of your project's source code hosted on a server or another machine, allowing collaboration and synchronization of changes.

**Adding Remotes**: Use git remote add [name] [url] to connect a local repository to a remote one.
**Listing Remotes**: Run git remote -v to view all configured remotes and their URLs.
**Renaming Remotes**: Update a remote's name with git remote rename [old-name] [new-name].
**Deleting Remotes**: Remove a remote using git remote remove [name].
Managing remotes effectively enables seamless collaboration and helps track changes from upstream sources.
