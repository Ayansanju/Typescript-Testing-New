# Typecasting

Typecasting, also known as type conversion, is the process of transforming a value from one data type (e.g., integer, string, float) to another. Python supports two types of type conversion:

Implicit Conversion:
This is automatically performed by Python when it converts a smaller or compatible data type to a larger or more encompassing data type without any loss of information (e.g., converting an integer to a float).

Explicit Conversion:
This is done manually by the programmer using typecasting functions like int(), float(), str(), etc. Explicit conversion is used when the programmer needs precise control over data transformations, especially when there is a potential for data loss or incompatibility.

Understanding typecasting is essential for effective programming in Python, ensuring seamless operations across different data types.
