# LLMs and How They Work

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are advanced AI systems trained to understand and generate human-like text. They work by learning patterns from massive amounts of text data and then predicting the most likely next word or phrase in a sentence. Under the hood, LLMs use neural networksâ€”especially a type called transformersâ€”to process and generate language based on the context theyâ€™re given. 

Understanding how LLMs work is essential for prompt engineering, as it helps you craft better inputs that lead to more accurate and useful outputs.
