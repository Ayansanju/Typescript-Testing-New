# Control Flow & Statements

**Control flow** refers to the order of execution of statements in the program. **Statements** are instructions that are executed sequentially.
C++ provides various statements to control the program flow.

Types of Control Flow statements in C++:

1. **Conditional/Selection Statements**: Executes a block of code only if a condition is fulfilled.
  - if-else
  - switch-case
2. **Looping/Iteration Statements**: Repeatedly executes a block of code until a condition is satisfied.
  - for
  - while
  - do-while
3. **Jump Statements**: Alters the flow of a program by jumping to specific locations.
  - break
  - continue
  - goto
  - return
