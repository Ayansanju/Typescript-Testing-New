# Control Flow & Statements
Control flow in C++ is the logic that determines how your code executes, in what order, and under what conditions. It gives your programs the ability to make decisions, repeat tasks, or skip certain parts of code—just like how we make decisions in everyday life.

Let’s understand this through real-life analogies:

Conditional Statements (if/else/switch)
Imagine you walk into a room and it's dark. If the light is off, you turn it on. Else, you do nothing. This is a decision based on a condition—just like an if statement.

Loops (for/while/do-while)
Think of eating a packet of chips. You eat one chip at a time until the packet is empty. This repetition is similar to a while or for loop that continues as long as a condition is true.

Break Statement
You’re watching episodes on Netflix, but suddenly get a call. You stop watching in the middle of the series. That’s how break works—it exits the loop or condition abruptly.

Continue Statement
Let’s say you’re checking homework. If one paper is unreadable, you skip it and move to the next one. That’s what continue does—it skips the current iteration and continues with the next.

Goto Statement
Imagine reading a book and suddenly flipping to Chapter 10 when the author says “jump ahead to Chapter 10 if you chose Option B.” That’s similar to goto, though it’s generally discouraged in modern code because it makes things harder to follow—just like skipping around in a book.

#Why It Matters
Without control flow, every program would run line by line from top to bottom—no decisions, no repetition, no flexibility. With it, your programs can respond to different situations, handle user inputs, loop through data, and build intelligent behaviors.

Learning control flow is your first step toward writing real, useful software—from simple games to complex apps.
