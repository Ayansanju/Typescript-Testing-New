# Objective-C Basics

**Introduction**

Objective-C is a powerful, object-oriented programming language primarily used for macOS and iOS development. While Swift has largely replaced it in modern Apple development, Objective-C remains essential for maintaining legacy codebases and understanding the foundations of Apple's ecosystem. This guide will introduce the fundamental concepts of Objective-C, helping you get started.

---

### 1. Understanding Objective-C
- Superset of C with object-oriented capabilities.
- Uses Smalltalk-style messaging (`[object message]` syntax).
- Supports dynamic typing and runtime decision-making.
- Historically required manual memory management (before ARC).

---

### 2. Setting Up Your Environment
- Install **Xcode** for macOS and iOS development.
- Use **Command Line Tools** to compile and run Objective-C programs.
- Verify installation using the `clang --version` command in the terminal.

---

### 3. Basic Syntax and Structure
- Uses `@import` or `#import` to include frameworks.
- `@autoreleasepool` manages memory automatically.
- `NSLog` is used for logging output.
- Uses pointers (`*`) for object references.

---

### 4. Variables and Data Types
- Supports standard C types: `int`, `double`, `bool`, etc.
- Common object types include `NSString`, `NSNumber`, and `NSArray`.
- Uses `@` symbol for object literals (e.g., `@"string"`, `@42`).

---

### 5. Object-Oriented Programming in Objective-C
- Classes are defined using `@interface` and `@implementation`.
- Instance methods are prefixed with `-`, while class methods use `+`.
- Uses dot notation for properties and `self` keyword within methods.
- Message passing uses square brackets (e.g., `[object method]`).

---

### 6. Memory Management
- Before **ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)**, developers used `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.
- ARC automatically manages memory for objects.
- Uses `strong`, `weak`, `copy`, and `assign` property attributes to control memory behavior.

---

### 7. Conclusion
- Objective-C is still relevant for legacy projects and bridging with Swift.
- Understanding Objective-C fundamentals helps when working with older Apple APIs.
- Next steps: Learn about protocols, categories, and runtime features.
