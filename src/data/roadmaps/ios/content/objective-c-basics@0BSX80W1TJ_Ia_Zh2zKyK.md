# Objective-C Basics

Objective-C is a programming language that was primarily used for developing applications on Apple's platforms, including macOS and iOS. It is an object-oriented language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. This combination allows developers to create dynamic and flexible applications.

Key features of Objective-C include:

Dynamic Typing: Unlike statically typed languages, Objective-C allows for dynamic typing, which can lead to more flexible code.
Message Passing: Objective-C uses a unique messaging syntax that allows objects to communicate with one another.
Rich Libraries: It has access to a wide range of libraries, particularly those provided by Apple, which can simplify many programming tasks.
For those looking to dive deeper into Objective-C, there are many resources available. Unfortunately, the search results did not yield specific articles, podcasts, or videos directly related to Objective-C basics. However, I recommend checking platforms like YouTube for introductory videos on Objective-C, as they often have comprehensive tutorials that can help beginners understand the language better.
