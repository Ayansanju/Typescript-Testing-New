## IOCP (I/O Completion Ports)

**I/O Completion Ports (IOCP)** are a high-performance asynchronous I/O model provided by the Windows operating system. They are essential for building scalable and efficient network servers and backend systems, allowing applications to handle numerous simultaneous I/O operations with minimal overhead.

### Introduction

IOCP facilitates the management of multiple concurrent I/O requests by decoupling the initiation of I/O operations from their completion. This model efficiently utilizes system resources by reusing threads to process completed I/O tasks, thereby enhancing the scalability and responsiveness of server-side applications. In backend development, especially for applications requiring high concurrency like game servers, web servers, and real-time data processing systems, IOCP proves to be invaluable in maintaining optimal performance and reliability.
