**io_uring** is a modern asynchronous I/O interface introduced in Linux kernel version 5.1. It provides a highly efficient and scalable mechanism for performing I/O operations, significantly reducing the overhead associated with traditional system calls. By leveraging shared memory between user space and the kernel, io_uring enables faster submission and completion of I/O tasks, making it ideal for high-performance applications such as web servers, databases, and real-time data processing systems.

### Introduction

io_uring revolutionizes asynchronous I/O in Linux by offering a more performant and flexible alternative to existing methods like `epoll` and `aio`. It utilizes a pair of ring buffers—one for submitting I/O requests and another for retrieving their completions—allowing applications to batch multiple I/O operations and handle them efficiently. This design minimizes context switches and system call overhead, resulting in lower latency and higher throughput. Developers can harness io_uring to build scalable and responsive backend systems that can handle a large number of concurrent I/O operations with ease.
