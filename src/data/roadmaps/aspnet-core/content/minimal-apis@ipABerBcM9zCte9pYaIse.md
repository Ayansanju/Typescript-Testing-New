# Minimal APIs
Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core are a simple way to create web APIs with less code. Instead of using controllers and many configurations, you can define API routes directly in the applicationâ€™s startup file.

They are lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making them great for small applications, microservices, and quick prototypes. You can still use features like dependency injection, middleware, and authentication, but with a simpler approach.

Minimal APIs are best for simple and small applications.
